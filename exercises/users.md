# Users

## Concept

The access to the system is granted for a _particular user._ The access to some subsystems/areas might be restricted. For instance, there is no need for a 'civil' user to change something in bootloader or system core or there's no need for one user to access other users' data.

By default the `root` user has unlimited access to whole system.
